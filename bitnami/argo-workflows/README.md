# Argo Workflows Chart packaged by Bitnami

[Argo Workflows](https://argoproj.github.io/workflows) allows to orchestrate parallel jobs in kubernetes.

## TL;DR

```console
$ helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
$ helm install my-release bitnami/argo-workflows
```

## Introduction

This chart bootstraps a [Argo Workflows](https://argoproj.github.io/workflows) deployment on a [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io) cluster using the [Helm](https://helm.sh) package manager.

Bitnami charts can be used with [Kubeapps](https://kubeapps.com/) for deployment and management of Helm Charts in clusters. This chart has been tested to work with NGINX Ingress, cert-manager, fluentd and Prometheus on top of the [BKPR](https://kubeprod.io/).

## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes 1.12+
- Helm 3.1.0
- PV provisioner support in the underlying infrastructure
- ReadWriteMany volumes for deployment scaling

## Installing the Chart

To install the chart with the release name `my-release`:

```console
helm install my-release bitnami/argo-workflowss
```

The command deploys Argo Workflows on the Kubernetes cluster in the default configuration. The [Parameters](#parameters) section lists the parameters that can be configured during installation.

> **Tip**: List all releases using `helm list`

## Uninstalling the Chart

To uninstall/delete the `my-release` deployment:

```console
helm delete my-release
```

The command removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart and deletes the release.

## Parameters

See https://github.com/bitnami-labs/readme-generator-for-helm to create the table

The above parameters map to the env variables defined in [bitnami/argo-workflow-cli](http://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-argo-workflow-cli). For more information please refer to the [bitnami/argo-workflow-cli](http://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-argo-workflows) image documentation.

Specify each parameter using the `--set key=value[,key=value]` argument to `helm install`. For example,

```console
helm install my-release \
  --set argo-workflowsUsername=admin \
  --set argo-workflowsPassword=password \
  --set mariadb.auth.rootPassword=secretpassword \
    bitnami/argo-workflows
```

The above command sets the Argo Workflows administrator account username and password to `admin` and `password` respectively. Additionally, it sets the MariaDB `root` user password to `secretpassword`.

> NOTE: Once this chart is deployed, it is not possible to change the application's access credentials, such as usernames or passwords, using Helm. To change these application credentials after deployment, delete any persistent volumes (PVs) used by the chart and re-deploy it, or use the application's built-in administrative tools if available.

Alternatively, a YAML file that specifies the values for the above parameters can be provided while installing the chart. For example,

```console
helm install my-release -f values.yaml bitnami/argo-workflows
```

> **Tip**: You can use the default [values.yaml](values.yaml)

## Configuration and installation details

### [Rolling VS Immutable tags](https://docs.bitnami.com/containers/how-to/understand-rolling-tags-containers/)

It is strongly recommended to use immutable tags in a production environment. This ensures your deployment does not change automatically if the same tag is updated with a different image.

Bitnami will release a new chart updating its containers if a new version of the main container, significant changes, or critical vulnerabilities exist.

### External database support

You may want to have Argo Workflows controller connect to an external database to store controller evidences. To achieve this, the chart allows you to specify credentials for an external database (using either postgresql or mysql) with the [`controller.persistence.postgresql.enabled` or `controller.persistence.mysql.enabled` parameter](#parameters). You should also set `persistence.enabled` to `true`. Here is an example:

```console
persistence.enabled=true
controller.persistence.postgresql.enabled=true
controller.persistence.postgresql.host=<host>
controller.persistence.postgresql.port=<port>
controller.persistence.postgresql.tableName=<table_name>
controller.persistence.postgresql.database=<database_name>
controller.persistence.postgresql.userNameSecret=<username_secret>
controller.persistence.postgresql.passwordSecret=<password_secret>
```

### Ingress

This chart provides support for Ingress resources. If you have an ingress controller installed on your cluster, such as [nginx-ingress-controller](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/master/bitnami/nginx-ingress-controller) or [contour](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/master/bitnami/contour) you can utilize the ingress controller to serve your application.

To enable Ingress integration, set `ingress.enabled` to `true`. The `ingress.hostname` property can be used to set the host name. The `ingress.tls` parameter can be used to add the TLS configuration for this host. It is also possible to have more than one host, with a separate TLS configuration for each host. [Learn more about configuring and using Ingress](https://docs.bitnami.com/kubernetes/apps/argo-workflows/configuration/configure-use-ingress/).

### TLS secrets

The chart also facilitates the creation of TLS secrets for use with the Ingress controller, with different options for certificate management. [Learn more about TLS secrets](https://docs.bitnami.com/kubernetes/apps/argo-workflows/administration/enable-tls/).

### Additional environment variables

In case you want to add extra environment variables (useful for advanced operations like custom init scripts), you can use the `extraEnvVars` property.

```yaml
argo-workflows:
  extraEnvVars:
    - name: LOG_LEVEL
      value: error
```

Alternatively, you can use a ConfigMap or a Secret with the environment variables. To do so, use the `extraEnvVarsCM` or the `extraEnvVarsSecret` values.

### Sidecars

If additional containers are needed in the same pod as argo-workflows (such as additional metrics or logging exporters), they can be defined using the `sidecars` parameter. If these sidecars export extra ports, extra port definitions can be added using the `service.extraPorts` parameter. [Learn more about configuring and using sidecar containers](https://docs.bitnami.com/kubernetes/apps/argo-workflows/administration/configure-use-sidecars/).

### Pod affinity

This chart allows you to set your custom affinity using the `affinity` parameter. Find more information about Pod affinity in the [kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/assign-pod-node/#affinity-and-anti-affinity).

As an alternative, use one of the preset configurations for pod affinity, pod anti-affinity, and node affinity available at the [bitnami/common](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/master/bitnami/common#affinities) chart. To do so, set the `podAffinityPreset`, `podAntiAffinityPreset`, or `nodeAffinityPreset` parameters.
