# Nginx

> nginx (pronounced "engine-x") is an open source reverse proxy server for HTTP, HTTPS, SMTP, POP3, and IMAP protocols, as well as a load balancer, HTTP cache, and a web server (origin server).

Based on the [Bitnami nginx](https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-nginx) image for docker, this Chart bootstraps a [nginx](http://www.nginx.org) deployment on a [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io) cluster using [Helm Classic](https://helm.sh).
